By requesting information from third party vendors and sponsors through the Portal, Registrants consent to use of their personal information for the purpose of “follow-up” contact by sponsors, including but not limited to direct mail, phone calls or email messages. Once a Registrant’s badge is scanned and/or Registrant provides information to third parties through the Portal, Organiser does not have control over what the exhibitor may do with his/her personal information. Organiser encourages Registrants to check with individual vendors and exhibitors regarding their specific privacy policies and purposes for collecting Registrants’ information when their badge is scanned at a booth. Any decision by Registrant to share personal information with any vendor/exhibitor is the sole responsibility of the Registrant. Organiser is not responsible for information provided by Registrants to vendors and/or exhibitors at any Conference Event or through the Portal nor is Organiser liable for anything done by vendors and/or exhibitors with such information.</p>
